Consumer spending and confidence have been affected by the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures, leading to cautious spending among consumers. This has resulted in a focus on value and the desire to stretch budgets further. Discretionary spending has decreased, while lower-priced items and everyday essentials have seen healthy demand. Third-party sellers, including those who use Fulfillment by Amazon, play a significant role in providing a wide selection for customers. The company has also invested in brand protection efforts and advertising services, with strong engagement and revenue growth in these areas.
