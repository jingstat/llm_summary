page_content="This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now, let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the first quarter, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range. This operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS.\n\nAs we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business, as well as Twitch, devices, advertising, and our human resources teams. In Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores revenue and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continued to ease quarter over quarter, primarily driven by reductions in linehaul shipping rates, as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements.\n\nWe exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network and leveraged that throughout Q1 with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we're able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our U.S. fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time." metadata={'source': 'data/amzn_earningtrans.txt', 'company': 'amzn_earningtrans.txt'}
