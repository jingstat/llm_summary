page_content='David, it’s Luca. As you said, of course we got the issue around the microeconomic environment, particularly in advertising and in mobile gaming. But outside of those areas, the behavior of customers continues to be pretty consistent that we are doing particularly well, obviously, in some of the services that we’ve launched more recently like payments where our growth rates are very strong, as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the new services that Tim mentioned. And the adoption continues to increase. Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more content on their devices, and so they adopt our cloud services. And in general, the model in the app store around paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions on the platform, and that’s almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So obviously, the growth in subscriptions, it’s very strong.\n\nDavid (41:30):\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nSpeaker 2 (41:32):\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator (41:38):\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik (41:44):' metadata={'source': 'data2/AAPL_Q2_2023.txt', 'company': 'AAPL_Q2_2023.txt'}
page_content='Internally we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer and the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs, and there’s more and more companies that are leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select, which is placed to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. But we’re certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.\n\nKrish Sankar (49:01):\n\nGot it. Tim, thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, obviously a lot of questions on the India retail opening. I’m just kind of curious, you also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you think the biggest opportunity? Is it primarily a hardware business like iPhone, iPad, wearables, et cetera, or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much.\n\nTim (49:28):\n\nI think there’s an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously the ARPUs are lower in India for whether you’re talking about TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPU are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there’s a good opportunity across the board.\n\nKrish Sankar (50:05):\n\nThanks a lot, Tim.\n\nTim (50:06):\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 3 (50:07):\n\nThanks Chris. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator (50:12):' metadata={'source': 'data2/AAPL_Q2_2023.txt', 'company': 'AAPL_Q2_2023.txt'}
