page_content='Speaker 3 (47:29):\n\nThanks Amit. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator (47:34):\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar (47:39):\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you’ve primarily been a consumer centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, the hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise versus consumer and does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, et cetera? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nTim (48:09):\n\nInternally we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer and the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs, and there’s more and more companies that are leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select, which is placed to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. But we’re certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.\n\nKrish Sankar (49:01):' metadata={'source': 'data/Apple.txt', 'company': 'Apple.txt'}
